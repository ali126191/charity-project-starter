The Vedanta teaches us that we are all divine, regardless of creed, class, gender, and ethnicity, and that our souls divinity may be manifested through worship, contemplation, and unselfish work.  At SVHM we welcome everyone.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Mandir is located close to Toronto, Brampton, Oakville, Richmond Hill, Milton, and Etobicoke. Come visit us today and join our community, all are welcome!</p>\r\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HGSDKG1Fqk</p>\r\n<h2>Hindu temple in mississauga</h2>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">SVHM is different from other the other temples and mandir's in and around Toronto, Richmond Hill, Brampton, and Mississauga as it is more family oriented and transparent. The temple does not fund any external political groups and adheres to CRA policies for non profit organizations. </p>\r\n<p>\"Immigrating from Northern India in 2016, I did not find a facility in Toronto that provided a place where I can pray, mediate, practice yoga, and meet other Canadian-Tibetans like myself. Then I discovered SVHM, which has been instrumental in my journey of transitioning into the Canadian lifestyle, helping me establish myself in the GTA, build a network of quality peers who share my values, and where I can peacefully pray.\"<br /><img src=\"https://shrivitthal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/25497478040_140ce47f31_k.jpg\" alt=\"25497478040_140ce47f31_k.jpg\" /><br />Tsering Wangchuk<br />Tibetan-Canadian</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">SVHM also does not discriminate – you do not need to be a “Hindu” or \"Indian\" to attend any event. We have numerous deities from other religions such as Sikhism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, to name a few . Shri Vitthal truly caters to the needs of every segment in Toronto! Our extraordinary temple is a vital part of the GTA that enriches not only the attending devotees but also the community as a whole.  All donations go back to the mandir to enhance services to our community.</p>\r\n<h3>A temple is what you want it to be. For the devotee it is the place where god lives. For the connoisseur of art, the sculpture and paintings make a temple a living museum. For a dancer the figures carved on the walls are the foundation of her art. For a musician or a poet the deity is both inspiration and the final audience. You don’t have to enter a temple to pray. You can go there to appreciate the many aspects of India’s rich and iridescent culture. ?</h3>\r\n<h2>what we offer</h2>\r\n<h2>Cultural Preservation</h2>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Through events and story telling, we keep the ancient Hindu traditions alive ensuring their adoption by the next generation of Canadians.</p>\r\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgabrMvtUrw</p>\r\n<h2>A place of worship</h2>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our primary divine figureheads are Vitthoba, Ganesh, &amp; Sai Baba however members of our community are free to worship and pray to their god/goddess of choice.
